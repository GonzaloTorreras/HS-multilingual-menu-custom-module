# Template - HubSpot Code Gallery Entry Repo Template
Use this repo structure as a template for your HubSpot Code Gallery submissions. Please fork this repo and build out your entry. 

* Your Documentation *
Please spend the time to create good documentation and step-by-step instructions in your readme file (the community appreciates it). If you’re looking for a good example, please review AJ LaPorte’s [“Speaker Lineup Cards” on GitHub](https://github.com/ajlaporte/Speaker-Lineup-Cards "AJ LaPorte's HubSpot Speaker Lineup Card Module, Code Gallery Submission").

* GIF Walk Throughs *
It’s recommended to include GIF recordings to show specific setup steps. You can use [RecordIt](http://recordit.co/ "RecordIt App for screen recording and GIFs") chrome extension to record these quickly. 

## Coded files (html, css and javascript)
.html, .css and .js files will be picked up automatically regardless of filename.
Files in each category will be listed in alphabetical order on the code gallery website.

## Screenshots

.jpeg, .jpg, .png and .gif files will be picked up automatically regardless of filename.
