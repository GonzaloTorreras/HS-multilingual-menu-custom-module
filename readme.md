# Multilingual menu module
This module is commonly used inside the header (global module). There you can choose one menu per language. So it basically allows you to have one template/header/footer for as many languages as you need.

Did I mention it also works in the system pages? :)


I will update this with extra info at some point, ideally before Dev day...
