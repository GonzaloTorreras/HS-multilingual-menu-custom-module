# Template - HubSpot Code Gallery Entry Repo Template
Use this repo structure as a template for your HubSpot Code Gallery submissions. Please fork this repo and build out your entry. 

* Your Documentation *
Please spend the time to create good documentation and step-by-step instructions in your readme file (the community appreciates it). If you’re looking for a good example, please review AJ LaPorte’s [“Speaker Lineup Cards” on GitHub](https://github.com/ajlaporte/Speaker-Lineup-Cards "AJ LaPorte's HubSpot Speaker Lineup Card Module, Code Gallery Submission").

* GIF Walk Throughs *
It’s recommended to include GIF recordings to show specific setup steps. You can use [RecordIt](http://recordit.co/ "RecordIt App for screen recording and GIFs") chrome extension to record these quickly.
